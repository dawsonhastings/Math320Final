I am a math 230 student and have done a lot of different things this semester, here is some of my previous work including my stats project and my generative art. 
generative art

The following three visulazations are my art projects I worked on in March

```{}
set.seed(2)
artwork3 = canvas_smoke(colors = c("#003366", "#336699", "#6699CC", "#FF6600", "#FF9933", "#FFCC99"))
saveCanvas(artwork3, filename="Bucknellart2.png")
```

generative art
```{}
set.seed(1)
artwork2 = canvas_planet(colors = c("#E81828","#002D72","grey","black"))
saveCanvas(artwork2, filename ="Bucknellart1.png")
```

```{}
set.seed(3)
artwork4=canvas_stripes(colors = c("gold","darkgreen","grey","green"))
saveCanvas(artwork4, filename = "Bucknellart3.png")
```

The Next two show two plots I made in the ggplot extension project

ggextensions

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
data("iris")
iris = iris[complete.cases(iris), ]
library(ggdensity)
attach(iris)
```


```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Length, fill=Species)) +
  geom_hdr_lines()+
  geom_point(shape=21)
```



```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Length, fill=Species)) +
  geom_hdr()+
  geom_point(shape=21) +
  facet_wrap(vars(Species)) + 
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2")
```
This last thing is my project on sampling distributuions

<iframe src="https://abby-flynt.shinyapps.io/SamplingDistributions_Dashboard_Team1/"class="l-screen-inset shaded" height="1000px"></iframe>


```{r}
curve(dnorm(x, 0, 1), from = -5, to = 5, col = 1, ylab = "", axes = FALSE, xlab = "", main = "Normal Distribution")
axis(1, at = c(-4, 0, 4), labels = c("", expression(mu), ""))
lines(x = c(0, 1), y = c(.1, .1), type = "o", pch = "|")
text(x = 0.5, y = 0.12, labels = expression(sigma))
```
This is something basic that we did in class but it is a bit different than the other visualizations

```{r}
library(Lock5Data)
data(StudentSurvey)
# Replace the data frame with a subsetted version that includes only the rows without 
# missing values.  
# Recall the potential ethical/moral/racial implications of throwing out data.
StudentSurvey = StudentSurvey[complete.cases(StudentSurvey), ]
# Making Year an ordered factor.
StudentSurvey$Year = factor(StudentSurvey$Year, 
                          levels = c("FirstYear", "Sophomore", "Junior", "Senior"),
                          ordered = TRUE)
```



```{r}
mycolorchoice = c("#E81828", "#002D72", "#6F263D","#6BACE4","green","yellow")
pulse.medians = aggregate(Pulse ~ Smoke, data = StudentSurvey, FUN = median)
pulse.medians

ggplot(survey, aes(x = Pulse, y = after_stat(density), color = Smoke, fill = Smoke)) +
  geom_density(alpha = .5) + 
  geom_vline(data = pulse.medians, aes(xintercept = Pulse, color = Smoke))+
  scale_color_manual(values = mycolorchoice) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = mycolorchoice)+
  ggtitle("Pulse rate of students based on smoking rate")
```
